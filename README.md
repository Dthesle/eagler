# Eaglercraft
> [!NOTE]
> EC stands for Eaglercraft.
> Another note: When you create a new world, it will be a black screen, or you may have spawned underground. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WAIT 30 SECONDS TO 5 MINUTES MAX! It will fix on its own. It will also be laggy at first, but it will smooth out after 5â€“10 minutes. Keep in mind that these are website/file versions of Minecraft and that not everything in the real current Minecraft will be avialable.

> [!CAUTION]
this can be taken down at any moment
also everything is broken atm so give me some time to fix it.
