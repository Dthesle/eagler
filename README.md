# Eaglercraft
> [!NOTE]
> EC stands for Eaglercraft.
> Another note: When you create a new world, it will be a black screen, or you may have spawned underground. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WAIT 30 SECONDS TO 5 MINUTES MAX! It will fix on its own. It will also be laggy at first, but it will smooth out after 5â€“10 minutes. Keep in mind that these are website/file versions of Minecraft and that not everything in the real current Minecraft will be avialable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> if you're on chromebook, when you download the files, they'll always be in your google drive.

> [!WARNING]
> Don't change ANYTHING besides the tab name in the code unless you want the entire file to break.

> [!CAUTION]
> This can be taken down at any moment and I completely understand.
> - everything is broken rn besides 1.8.8

> [!TIP]
> Download for better usage and portability, blah blah blah
