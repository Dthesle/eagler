> [!NOTE]
> EC stands for Eaglercraft.
> - **Extra Note:** I do not own Eaglercraft, nor did I make Eaglercraft, and I am not associated with it in any way, this is just a way for people to access it fullscreen on browser.
>   - **Another note:** When you create a new world, it will be a black screen, or you may have spawned underground. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WAIT 30 SECONDS TO 5 MINUTES MAX! It will fix on its own. It will also be laggy at first, but it will smooth out after 5â€“10 minutes. Keep in mind that these are website/file versions of Minecraft and that not everything in the real current Minecraft will be avialable.
>     - **Another Extra Note:** the links may be blocked accorrding to me since my blocker consistently blocks links (Lightspeed Filter Agent)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> if you're on chromebook, when you download the files, they'll always be in your google drive.
>  - if you're on a managed computer (such as windows) it'll always be in your file explorer, like for example:
<h3 align="center">
  <img src="help.png" width="512" alt="DownloadsInFileExplorer">
</h3>

> [!WARNING]
> Don't change ANYTHING besides the tab name in the code unless you want the entire file to break.

> [!CAUTION]
> This can be taken down at any moment and I completely understand.
> - everything is broken rn besides 1.8.8 (file) and the links

> [!TIP]
> Download for better usage and portability, blah blah blah
